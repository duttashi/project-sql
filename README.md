# pysqlr

This repository contains scripts for database interfacing. Primarily, the database will be `MySql 8.0.19` and the interfacing languages are `python 3.7` and `R 3.6.1`.

### General information

#### Summary

The world wide web is full of data that are of great interest to scientists and businesses alike. Firms, public institutions, and private users provide every imaginable type of information, and new channels of communication generate vast amounts of data on human behavior. But how to efficiently use the data present in either offline or online database's, is an interesting question. I will answer such questions by creating effective solutions in this repository.
